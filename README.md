# Etch-a-Sketch
browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
My etch a sketch displays a grid, that can be draw on by left clicking with the mouse and 
hovering over the squares you are looking to color in. The number of squares in the grid by default is 16 x 16
but can be as small as 1 x 1 and as a big as 64 x 64. The number of squares in the grid can be adjusted by moving the slider on the bottom left of the grid. Next to the slider there is a color mode section, there are three radio buttons that allow's the user to choose what color mode to use on the grid. The rgb mode will put random colors on the grid, normal mode will put black on the grid, and eraser will erase the cells that you choose to erase.
